# HIMYM-Character-Frequency-Visualizer

**Project Name: HIMYM Character Frequency Visualizer**

**Description:**
This project aims to visualize the frequency of character names from the popular TV show "How I Met Your Mother" using Python and Plotly. The provided Python script generates a bar chart that displays the frequency distribution of randomly selected character names from the show.

**Features:**
- Random selection of character names from the predefined list.
- Utilization of Plotly for interactive and visually appealing bar chart generation.
- Identification of characters with the highest frequency.

**Usage:**
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using 'pip install plotly'.
3. Run the `himym_character_frequency.py` script.
4. View the generated HTML file to visualize the frequency distribution of character names.

**File Structure:**
- `himym_character_frequency.py`: Python script containing the code for generating the frequency visualization.

**Instructions:**
1. Modify the `names` list in the Python script to include additional character names if desired.
2. Adjust the number of iterations in the loop to increase or decrease the sample size for character name selection.
3. Customize the chart layout and styling by modifying the relevant parameters in the script.
4. Experiment with different Plotly functionalities to enhance the visualization as needed.
